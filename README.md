# GhostLock-Galaxy

> 中文: [README_ZH.md](README_ZH.md)

This is a separate repository because this route requires Android shell
permission, obtained through `adb shell` or Shizuku. The original
[YuKongA/ghostlock-app](https://github.com/YuKongA/ghostlock-app) does not use
shell permission and follows a different execution route; its requirements
and code path should not be assumed to be interchangeable with this project.

## Supported device

| Device | Kernel |
| ------ | ------ |
| Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 (SM-F9560 / q6q) | `6.1.145-android14-11-3254009-abF9560ZCS4DZG3` |
| Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 (SM-F956U1) | `6.1.145-android14-11-33418572-abF956USQS4DZG3` — image-derived candidate; live validation pending |

At startup the kernel is matched against the offset table via `uname -r`; unsupported kernels are rejected immediately.

### SM-F956U1 porting status

`SM-F956U1` is a separate target even though it is the same Fold6 family. Do
not copy the `SM-F9560` offsets until the complete kernel image has been
compared or the target has been extracted and validated. The firmware build
identifier alone is not enough to establish binary identity across regional
variants.

The exact AP package has now been extracted outside Git. The candidate is in
`src/devices/f956u1-ues4dzg3/offsets.h`; it still requires live validation.
For reproducibility, the relevant inputs are the AP package for
`F956U1UES4DZG3`, especially:

- `boot.img.lz4`, decompressed to `boot.img`;
- `xbl_config.img.lz4`, decompressed to the XBL configuration image (the
  extracted copy used here is named `xbl_config.elf`); and
- a matching `kallsyms` source, plus `llvm-objdump` from the Android NDK when
  automatic disassembly is available.

Keep the firmware archive and extracted images outside Git. Once those inputs
are available, generate a candidate target header with:

```powershell
python tools/extract_target.py `
  boot.img `
  --xbl-config xbl_config.img `
  --kallsyms kallsyms.txt `
  --device f956u1-ues4dzg3
```

If `llvm-objdump.exe` is not already on `PATH`, add
`--llvm-objdump <path-to-llvm-objdump.exe>` so the script can derive the
disassembly-dependent fields instead of using its fallback heuristic.

The generated entry must be reviewed against the device's live `uname -r`,
the extractor report, and a debug build before use. The original `SM-F9560`
entry remains unchanged until the new target is independently validated.

## Quick Start

For the APK path, start Shizuku through wireless debugging, grant GhostLock permission, and tap **Run**. Shizuku starts the payload as the Android shell user; the APK itself is not the exploit execution context.

## Command-Line Debugging

The direct command-line path runs the same verified shell payload without requiring Shizuku:

```powershell
make ghostlock helper
adb push ghostlock /data/local/tmp/ghostlock
adb push ghostlock-helper /data/local/tmp/ghostlock-helper
adb push app/src/main/assets/ksud-zfold6-F9560ZCS4DZG3-samsung-main-no-patch-text-kdp /data/local/tmp/ksud-zfold6-F9560ZCS4DZG3-samsung-main-no-patch-text-kdp
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/ghostlock
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/ghostlock-helper
adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/ksud-zfold6-F9560ZCS4DZG3-samsung-main-no-patch-text-kdp
adb shell /data/local/tmp/ghostlock
```

The helper is required by the UMH root and KernelSU late-load stages.

## KernelSU 6.1 build notes

On some Samsung/Exynos 6.1 kernels, a generic KernelSU module can trigger an
EL2 panic during `ksud late-load` because the module attempts live text
patching. For affected targets, build a module for the exact firmware release
and enable the target tree's no-patch-text option:

```text
CONFIG_KSU_SAMSUNG_NO_PATCH_TEXT=y
```

Pair the target-specific `kernelsu.ko` and `ksud`, and match the device's
complete `uname -r` rather than only the `6.1` KMI. A reboot during late-load
can come from the module's initialization, not necessarily from the `ksud`
loader. This is a Samsung/Exynos-specific precaution; the current SM-F9560
target is Snapdragon and must be validated separately. See
[Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads](https://github.com/BuSung-dev/Root-My-Galaxy-Payloads)
for target-specific build examples.

## Offset Extraction

On Qualcomm devices, `tools/extract_target.py` parses offsets from `boot.img` and `xbl_config.img`. Requires Python 3 and a kallsyms source (`--kallsyms` file or `--kallsyms-finder`). Passing `--llvm-objdump` (or having `llvm-objdump` on PATH/NDK) additionally disassembles the kernel to auto-derive `pselect_waiter_shift` and `off_slide_loggers_0_1`:

```powershell
python tools/extract_target.py `
  boot.img `
  --xbl-config xbl_config.img `
  --format c `
  --out offsets.h
```

### pselect route feasibility

`core_sys_select` copies only 3 x `FDS_BYTES(nfds)` of user fd_set data onto the kernel stack (qwords 0..14 for nfds=320). The futex waiter must land inside that controllable zone: waiter start word + 11 (lock field) <= 14, i.e. the derived shift (waiter offset from the fd_set in qwords) must be <= 3, or task/lock fall into the kernel-zeroed tail and the route cannot work. The script fails with a clear error when the layout is infeasible.
